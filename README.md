# links

Self-hosted Linktree clone

The data file that builds my [links site](https://links.davecross.co.uk/).

Most of the hard work is done by my
[linksite](https://github.com/davorg-cpan/app-linksite) program.

But you might be interested in the
[GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/davorg/links/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml)
that rebuilds the site automatically whenever the input data changes.
